    "## Working with the Morlet Wavelet\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Morlet Wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morlet_wavelet) (${\\displaystyle \\psi}$) is one type of mother wavelet that is sensitive to time-limited and band-limited sinusoidal fluctuations. Conceptually, the mother wavlet of the Morlet family is generated by multiplying a sinuisoidal wave of a single frequency with a time-varying Gaussian envelope. Children are based on parametrizations of these components:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ${\\displaystyle \\psi _{\\omega,\\sigma}(t) = C * e^{j{\\omega}t} * e^{\\frac{-t^{2}}{\\sigma^2}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sinusoid ($e^{j{\\omega}t}$) is parametrized by:\n",
    "  - Center or fundamental frequency ($\\omega$) of the child wavelet.\n",
    "    - **Note:** this \"exponential representation\" is derived from [Euler's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula), which is a mathematical tool for representing cicular data in the complex-valued domain:\n",
    "          ${\\displaystyle Ce^{j{\\omega}t}=C\\cos {\\omega}t + jC \\sin {\\omega}t}$;  where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$\n",
    "- The time-varying Gaussian envelope  ($e^{\\frac{-t^{2}}{\\sigma^2}}$) is parametrized by:\n",
    "    -  Standard deviation ($\\sigma$) defines the width or roll-off of the masking envelope.\n",
    "    -  Larger standard deviation results in a Gaussian envelope with a slower and wider roll-off. The result of increasing the standard deviation is that the child wavelet becomes longer and samples more cycles/periods of the sinusoid. This yields a more precise measurement of the frequency content of the signal (reduces the bandwidth around the center frequency), but trades off temporal precision. In contrast, a smaller standard deviation improves temporal precision by shortening the length of the wavelet but reduces frequency precision (increases spectral leakage by increasing bandwidth around center frequency).\n",
    "    -  Standard deviation dictates the length of the child wavelet by directly constraining the number of cycles ($n$), or periods, of the sinusoid that are measured ($\\sigma = \\frac{n}{\\omega}$).\n",
    "- A normalization constant $C$ is also defined to ensure that different child wavelets are weighted equally. Put another way, the child wavelets must have the same [\"energy\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_(signal_processing)), constrained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $\\sum{|\\psi _{\\omega,\\sigma}(t)^2|} = 1$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Therefore, $C = \\frac{1}{\\sum{|\\psi _{\\omega,\\sigma}(t)^2|}}$."
